# Heart-Disease-Analysis
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease risk using a dataset of health-related features. The project utilizes various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and implements two classification algorithms: Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves are used to evaluate model effectiveness.

Features:
        -Data cleaning and preprocessing
        -Encoding of categorical variables
        -Scaling of features using MinMaxScaler
        -Class balancing to address imbalanced datasets
        -Model training and evaluation with Random Forest and Logistic Regression
        -Visualization of model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves
Technologies Used:
        -Python
        -Pandas
        -Scikit-learn
        -Seaborn
        -Jupyter Notebook
